## GroceryApp

A personal grocery items list built using the MEAN.js stack.

## Duration

Start time = 8:20pm

End time = 11:05pm

Total = 2h 45min

## Installation

npm install

## Testing (runs the entire tests suite including e2e)

grunt test

## Running the stack

grunt

## Conclusions

It was a blast setting up e2e tests (new for me). They require
a bit of work to properly extend the test to cover auth/non auth
users, but overall another dimension to the test suite that can
help with integration / BDD style tests.

Overall I am happy with the results and I hope you are too!

Thank you very much for your consideration.


Sincerely,

Eric Robitaille
